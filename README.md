Based on the LR Delivery Time Prediction Chinmay H R.pdf and the Jupyter Notebook, here is the structured README.md file. I have designed it with attractive visuals and a professional structure suitable for a portfolio.🚚 Porter Delivery Time Estimation (Linear Regression)Author: Chinmay H RProject Type: Regression Analysis / Supply Chain AnalyticsTech Stack: Python (Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Pandas, Seaborn)(Above: Optimizing last-mile delivery is crucial for modern logistics)📌 Project OverviewPorter, India's largest marketplace for intra-city logistics, strives to improve customer experience by providing accurate delivery time estimates1. Inaccurate estimates can lead to customer dissatisfaction or inefficient driver allocation.This project utilizes Linear Regression to predict the estimated_duration of a delivery based on real-world features such as the number of items, available dashers (drivers), and market conditions2.📂 Repository StructureLR_Delivery_Time_Pridiction_Chinmay_ H_R.ipynb: The core analysis notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, and model training.LR Delivery Time Prediction Chinmay H R.pdf: Detailed project report and presentation.dataset.csv: (Reference) The dataset containing historical delivery records.⚙️ Data Pipeline1. Data PreprocessingThe raw dataset required significant cleaning to handle real-world inconsistencies:Missing Values: Imputed nulls in store_primary_category and total_onshift_dashers using mode/mean imputation3.Feature Engineering:busy_dashers_ratio: Calculated as total_busy_dashers / total_onshift_dashers to measure fleet utilization.time_of_day: Extracted hour and day from created_at timestamps to capture traffic patterns4.Encoding: Applied Target Encoding and Frequency Encoding for high-cardinality categorical variables like market_id and store_id5.2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)We visualized the relationships between variables to understand cost drivers.Total Items vs. Duration: A positive correlation was observed; as the number of items increases, the delivery and handling time naturally increases6.Dashers Availability: Higher availability of dashers (total_onshift_dashers) generally correlates with lower delivery times, though the relationship is non-linear due to demand spikes7.Getty Images3. Model BuildingWe implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Linear Regression models.Baseline: Simple Linear Regression using total_outstanding_orders.Multivariate: Complex model including subtotal, num_distinct_items, and busy_dashers_ratio.Evaluation: The model was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² Score to ensure goodness of fit8.📊 Model PerformanceMetricScoreRMSE (Test Set)[Insert specific value from notebook output]R² Score[Insert specific value from notebook output](Note: The model successfully captures the general trend, though outliers in "actual_delivery_time" suggest the need for robust regression or tree-based models in future iterations).🚀 Key Insights for OperationsBased on the coefficients and EDA, the following insights were derived for Porter:Dasher Utilization is Key: The ratio of busy dashers is a strong predictor. High utilization significantly delays orders, suggesting a need for dynamic pricing or driver incentives during peaks9.Order Complexity: It's not just the count of items but the distinct number of items that drives up time (likely due to prep time at restaurants)10.Market Variance: Different market_id regions have distinct baseline delivery times, likely due to traffic and density differences11.🛠️ How to RunClone the repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/Porter-Delivery-Prediction.git
